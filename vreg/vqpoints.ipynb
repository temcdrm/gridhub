    "Within the scope of IEEE 1547-2018, the table of points may also be shifted with a reactive power bias level, *Qbias*. This has the effect of implementing a constant Q mode, modified by a volt-var response to voltage deviations. This allows DER to participate in steady-state grid voltage control as a reactive power resource, dispatched like shunt capacitors or reactors, but still responding autonomously to local voltage excursions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following Python code cell to repeat the preceding five example volt-var characteristics, with positive (capacitive) and negative (inductive) bias levels for steady-state reactive power from the DER. In all cases, *Qbias* is 0.1 pu of the DER rating. This bias point is plotted in blue at V=1.00 pu, but it's no longer centered on the horizontal axis.  The intervals V2-V1 and V4-V3 are no longer equal, but they define equal regulation slopes that terminate properly on (V1, Q1) and (V4, Q4). In another workbook, it will be shown that after a voltage fluctuation, the steady-state reactive power will depend on whether AARV has been enabled. With AARV, Q will eventually return to *Qbias* but without AARV, Q will remain at a different value when the voltage remains outside the fixed deadband.\n",

Per the standard, when *Vref*=1, V1 must be at least 0.82 pu and V4 no greater than 1.18 pu.
